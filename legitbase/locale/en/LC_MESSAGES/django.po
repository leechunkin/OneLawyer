It is for the Secretary and those who prosecute on the Secretary's behalf to decide whether or not a prosecution should be instituted in any particular case. In determining whether or not to prosecute, the Secretary considers two issues:"

msgid "cri-text2"
msgstr "First, is the evidence sufficient to justify the institution of proceedings?"

msgid "cri-text3"
msgstr "Second, if it is, does the public interest require a prosecution to take place?"

msgid "cri-text4"
msgstr "In making that decision the Secretary for Justice is not subject to any instructions or directions from Government Executive bodies."

msgid "cri-text5"
msgstr "In practice, many prosecutions at the summary level (less serious or simple cases) which are processed by the Police or other investigative bodies do not require the specific involvement of the Secretary for Justice. At the same time, all such cases are scrutinized at the Magistrates Courts by Senior Court Prosecutors acting on behalf of the Secretary."

msgid "cri-text6"
msgstr "The most serious criminal offences such as murder, manslaughter, rape, armed robbery and certain drug offences are tried by a judge at the Court of First Instance of High Court with a jury of seven or nine people. The sole duty of the jury is to decide whether the accused is guilty or not guilty. A judge will urge a jury to strive for unanimity in reaching their verdict but a jury may return a majority verdict of five to two or seven to two."

If the accused person pleads guilty, the court will convict that person without a trial so long as the summary of facts prepared by the prosecution and agreed by him/her are sufficient to show the commission of the offence. If the accused person pleads not guilty, then a trial becomes necessary to determine whether or not that person is guilty of the offence."

msgid "cri-text16"
msgstr "At the trial, the burden of proof is generally on the prosecution, which has to convince the court that the accused person is guilty of the offence beyond reasonable doubt . That means the prosecution must present sufficient evidence to the court so that the court can be sure that all the ingredients of the offence charged against the accused have been proven. If there is any reasonable doubt that a particular ingredient of the offence may not have been proven, then the accused person should be acquitted of the offence. The accused person is not required to prove that he or she is not guilty, and can decide whether to give evidence at the trial or not."

msgid "cla-text3"
msgstr "There is no compulsory insurance covering any claims directed at recovery agents and they are of unknown financial backing.  Since accident compensation in Hong Kong is assessed on the basis of actual loss, victims using recovery agents will not be adequately compensated as part of their compensation has to be paid to the recovery agents.  The more seriously injured victims may then not have sufficient means to maintain their livelihood."

msgid "cla-text4"
msgstr "Recovery agency contracts are generally champertous in nature and are unenforceable.  Maintenance (of which champerty is a more serious form) remains a criminal offence in Hong Kong and recovery agents are liable to be prosecuted.  Accident victims relying on recovery agents are likely to jeopardize their chances of getting the best possible redress.  Accident victims should approach solicitors or the Legal Aid Department directly."

msgid "cla-text8"

msgstr "A civil case relates to the legal rights and obligations between two or more persons or institutions. In the event that the parties concerned cannot resolve a dispute themselves, either party may start a civil litigation. This is done in order to seek an independent and impartial tribunal's or court's determination as to whether one's legal rights and obligations are being infringed, and if so, to obtain appropriate compensation and remedy."

msgid "civ-text3"
msgstr "Civil litigation should be distinguished from criminal litigation. The main difference is that civil litigation is normally undertaken by an individual to seek monetary compensation, to recover properties, or to enforce obligations, while the criminal litigation is instituted in the name of the Government (i.e. the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) to suppress crime and to punish criminals."

msgid "civ-text4"
msgstr "A person or a company or even the Government can be a party in a civil case. The party who sues is called 'the plaintiff' or 'the claimant', and the party being sued is called 'the defendant' or 'the respondent'. The plaintiffs/claimants have a duty to prove that what they claim is correct based on the balance of probabilities (i.e. it is more likely than not that what they claim is true).
